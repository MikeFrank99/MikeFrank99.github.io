# GEMINI.md - Context for "Michael Francazzi | Digital Architect"

This project is a minimalist personal portfolio website for Michael Francazzi, hosted on GitHub Pages. It has been transitioned from a MkDocs documentation site to a single-page static HTML application to ensure a clean, high-performance, and bespoke visual experience.

## Project Overview
- **Purpose**: Personal portfolio showcasing philosophy and digital architectural approach.
- **Main Technologies**: 
    - **HTML5/CSS3**: Pure static implementation for maximum speed.
    - **Google Fonts**: Utilizing "Inter" for modern typography.
    - **Custom Design**: Minimalist layout with high-impact visuals (church fresco/Renaissance background).

## Structure
- `index.html`: The main entry point containing all structure, styles, and content.
- `assets/images/background.jpg`: Local high-resolution background image (Andrea Pozzo's fresco or similar religious art).
- `CNAME`: Configuration for the custom domain `michaelfrancazzi.com`.
- `.nojekyll`: Prevents GitHub Pages from running Jekyll processing, allowing direct serving of the HTML file.

## Key Design Elements
- **Minimalism**: Focus on core philosophy (Semplifica, Esegui, Evolvi).
- **Typography**: Heavy, uppercase headers with letter-spacing for a premium feel.
- **Visuals**: Dark overlays on classical art backgrounds to create a "Digital Architect" aesthetic.

## Deployment
- Hosted on **GitHub Pages**.
- Deployment source: `main` branch, root directory.
- Domain managed via **Cloudflare** (Mode: Full/Full Strict).

## Notes for Gemini
- Avoid re-introducing MkDocs or Jekyll dependencies unless explicitly requested.
- Maintain the "Digital Architect" aesthetic: high contrast, minimalist structure, and classical art influences.
- All modifications should be made directly to `index.html` or the `assets/` directory.
